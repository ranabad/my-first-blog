# Rana's Personal Blog
This project is my attempt at the Bridging Coursework:

* Website blog has posting, commenting,and editing for blog posts
* Website also has a CV page which displays my current CV
* components of CV page(Education, Experience, Workshops, Skills) are non-static and can be updated or deleted
* CV page contains a contact form for queries 
* Everything else in CV page is static
